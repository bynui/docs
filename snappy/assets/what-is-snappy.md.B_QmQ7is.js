Built on solid Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, it delivers clean, fast response generation (JSON, JSONP, XML, HTML), and a semi-automatic routing system that maps HTTP methods directly to controller functions without the need for a separate route file, while still giving you full control.</p><h2 id="why-snappy" tabindex="-1">Why Snappy? <a class="header-anchor" href="#why-snappy" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Why Snappy?&quot;">​</a></h2><p>This framework was created to meet the needs of small to medium-scale projects that often require rapid development and deployment. While existing backend frameworks offer many features, they may not always align with the simplicity and speed required for certain use cases. This lightweight framework was built to streamline backend development while maintaining flexibility and clarity.</p><p>It has now been open-sourced in the hope that it may also be useful to others with similar needs.
